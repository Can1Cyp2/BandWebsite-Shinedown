There have been other band members that were previously in the band but no longer are, their names are Jason Todd and Brad Stewert. They were at the time of leaving the band said to have left on their own without influence from others in the band but that was found to be untrue when it was said in an interview from Brent saying that their was an influence of drugs in the band and it was coming from those two previuos members Jason and Brad. Brent stated that he wanted to get clean and so he removed those members from the band.</h1>

          Youâ€™re all the hate that we share&quot;</h1>
          <h1>This could easily be a reference to the band members being kicked out instead of leaving. The music video itself is a hint towards the band not previously working. The video consists of the band having a &quot;band meeting&quot; with the new  members and they start to sing the lyrics of the song while fighting. The video was obviously a joke but the fact that this is the first song people saw with the new members and the video and the lyrics shows that their could be more to the members being kicked out.</h1></td>
